Simple Factory

	1. Create different weapon types in the game
		- currently there are 3 types of weapons PISTOL, MACHINE_GUN and ROCKET
		- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change

	keywords:
		- create -> creational pattern
		- different weapon types -> objects from a framework
		- risk is 100% 
		- new types will appear/existing ones will change -> code should be independent of those changes, no need to rewrite the entire class.
		- tight coupling transforms in loose coupling.



Prototype

	2. In order to allow other companies or players to develop external solutions that connect to the game, a library (an API) must be developed.
		- The API contains many classes with many details
		- not all classes are documented
		- The API should provide a simplified interface for a set of basic functions
