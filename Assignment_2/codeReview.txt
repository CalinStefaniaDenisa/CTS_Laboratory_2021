Code Review 

Code formatting
	- code is not formatted properly - too many spaces or none at all
	- code should fit in one screen
	- misplaced comments -  //	1.25% broker's fee
	- useless comments
	- sections of code without proper indentation

Naming conventions
	- naming conventions not respected (lowerCamelCase) - loan_value, account_Type, to_string()
	- meaningless variables names - temp, value, vb
		- rename variable temp to daysInYear
		- rename variable value to loanValue
	- meaningless function names - loan(), setValue(), calculate()
		- rename function loan() to getLoanValue()
		- rename setValue() to setLoanValue()

Implementation
	- remove hard-coded value - broker's fee, number of days in a year
	- group similar values under an enumeration 
		- create AccountType enum
	- visibility type not specified for getLoan()
		-specify public visibility
	- declared but unused functions and variables - Y.A.G.N.I.
		- delete print() function
		- delete temp variable
	- there are setters and getters for public variables
		- make variables private
	- thrown exceptions aren't custom
		- throw custom exception for invalid loan value
	- code is not self explanatory
	- the function calculate() should do a single thing - S.R.P.
		- create new functions:
			- to calculate the compound interest value
			- to calculate the number of compounding periods
			- to calculate the number of days in the current year
	- D.R.Y. principle not respected in constructor
		- use setLoanValue() function
	- argument missing from constructor - daysActive
	- S.R.P. not respected in class
		- calculateTotalFee() for only one account, not for an array of accounts
	- excessive use of useless logs
