Code Review 


Code formatting

	- code is not formatted properly - too many spaces or none at all
	
	- code should fit in one screen
	
	- misplaced comments -  //	1.25% broker's fee
	
	- useless comments
	
	- sections of code without proper indentation



Naming conventions

	- naming conventions not respected (lowerCamelCase) - loan_value, account_Type, to_string()
	
	- meaningless variables names - temp, value, vb
		- rename variable temp to daysInYear
		- rename variable value to loanValue
		
	- meaningless function names - loan(), setValue(), calculate()
		- rename function loan() to getLoanValue()
		- rename setValue() to setLoanValue()



Implementation

	- remove hard-coded value - broker's fee, number of days in a year
	
	- group similar values under an enumeration 
		- create AccountType enum
		
	- visibility type not specified for getLoan()
		-specify public visibility
		
	- declared but unused functions and variables - Y.A.G.N.I.
		- delete print() function
		- delete temp variable
		
	- incapsulation not respected - variables should be private
	
	- thrown exceptions aren't custom
		- throw custom exception for invalid loan value
		
	- code is not self explanatory
	
	- calculate() function shouldn't be static 
	
	- S.R.P. not respected in the function calculate()
		- create new functions:
			- to calculate the compound interest value
			- to calculate the number of compounding periods
			- to calculate the number of days in the current year
			
	- S.R.P. not respected in class
		- calculate() for only one account, not for an array of accounts
		
	- D.R.Y. principle not respected in constructor
		- use setLoanValue() function
		
	- argument missing from constructor - daysActive
	
	- excessive use of useless logs
	
	- to_string() method doesn't override correctly
