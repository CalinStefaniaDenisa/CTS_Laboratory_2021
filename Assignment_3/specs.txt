Assignment 3 - Creational and Structural design patterns

Based on your bachelor paper topic define scenarios that justify the implementation of some creative and structural design patterns:


     Singleton
     Factory (Simple or Method)
     Builder
     Prototype
     Decorator
     Adapter
     Proxy
     Flyweight
     Composite (optional)

Each pattern is implemented in its own subpackage according to the seminar approach. The subpackage also contains a text file with:
- the title of the bachelor topic
- description of the problem to be solved by pattern
- advantages for the solution (2-3 bullets)
- disadvantages (2-3 bullets)

All patterns are tested in a TestAssignment.java class in the root package.

The parent package in which you work has the name name.surname.gNrGroup

The solution is loaded in the form of a .zip file that contains the root of the main package (the directory in src/)
