Title of the bachelor topic: 
	Mood-driven travel web application


Description of the problem to be solved by SIMPLE FACTORY pattern:
	Create different destination types in the application
		- currently there are 3 types of destinations BEACH_VACATION, CRUISE, CAMPING_VACATION.
		- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change
		

Advantages for the solution:
	- the code only deals with the product interfaces; therefore, it can work with any user-defined concrete product classes
	- connects the class hierarchies with minimum coupling


Disadvantages:
	- clients might have to sub-class the creator class just to create a particular concrete product object
	- the factory used for creating the objects is bound with the client code
