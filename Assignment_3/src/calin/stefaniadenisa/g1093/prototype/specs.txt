Title of the bachelor topic: 
	Mood-driven travel web application


Description of the problem to be solved by PROTOTYPE pattern:
	
	All destinations have virtual tours available.
	- instances of the same destination can appear in the application
	- creating the 3D model is an expensive process because it involves loading and generating the model
	- an efficient solution must be found to create several instances of the same destination
	

Advantages for the solution:
	- instead of creating new instances, i may create the instances with the appropriate state beforehand and then clone them whenever i want
	- high flexibility - i may add or remove prototypes at run-time

Disadvantages:
	- the process could get complex when there are many classes
	- it's difficult to clone classes that have circular references
