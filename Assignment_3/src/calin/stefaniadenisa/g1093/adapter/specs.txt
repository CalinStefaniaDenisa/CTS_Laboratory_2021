Title of the bachelor topic: 
	Mood-driven travel web application


Description of the problem to be solved by ADAPTER pattern:

	To develop an online application (with travel ideas) implement a software solution that allows the use of an external library that contains Romantic travel destinations, for the honeymoon.
	Currently the game contains its own destinations that are part of the ACME framework

	
	Advantages for the solution:
	- helps achieve reusability and flexibility
	- client class is not complicated by having to use a different interface and can use polymorphism to swap between different implementations of adapters


Disadvantages:
	- adapters aren't transparent to clients
	- sometimes many adaptations are required along an adapter chain to reach the type which is required
