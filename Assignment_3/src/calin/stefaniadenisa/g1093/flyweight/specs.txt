Title of the bachelor topic: 
	Mood-driven travel web application


Description of the problem to be solved by FLYWEIGHT pattern:
	To efficiently manage (from a memory point of view) scenarios in which tourists choose multiple destinations for the same trip find a solution based on:
	- the collection of destinations contains elements of the same kind (the same 3D models)
	- the space occupied by a 3D model is significant
	- generating such a scenario requires a significant memory space for the client
	- 3D models are displayed on the screen at different coordinates and can have textures of different colors
	- an efficient solution must be found regarding the management of these situations
	

Advantages for the solution:
	- space savings
	- improved data caching for higher response time


Disadvantages:
	- may introduce run-time costs associated with transferring, finding and computing extrinsic state
	- shared objects may be not eligible for garbage collection
